## Compression Techniques for Inverted Lists in Web Search Engines
## Inverted Lists Structure for Semi-Structured Web Data Search

The Semantic Web is a set of layers that wraps the current web and adds useful meta-information describing web documents' content. This semantic information has a structured format, allowing web documents to be exploitable by humans and machines alike. In the latter case, machines permit a more comprehensive use of the colossal amount of knowledge in the Web. The number of such documents can already be counted in millions and is increasing rapidly. This calls for large scale systems that are able to search through this data and to retrieve relevant information. This report highlights that the time spent on IO operations for such systems is wasted, and thus reviews two approaches to answer this problem. We propose a compression method that increases both the update and the query throughput of the system. We introduce also a model that skips over data, avoiding to read unnecessary data.
