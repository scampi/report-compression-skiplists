\abstract{%
\\*[\parskip]
The Semantic Web is a set of layers that wraps the current web and adds useful
meta-information describing web documents' content. This semantic information
has a structured format, allowing web documents to be exploitable by humans and
machines alike. In the latter case, machines permit a more comprehensive use of
the colossal amount of knowledge in the Web. The number of such documents can
already be counted in millions and is increasing rapidly. This calls for large
scale systems that are able to search through this data and to retrieve
relevant information. This report highlights that the time spent on IO
operations for such systems is wasted, and thus reviews two approaches to
answer this problem. We propose a compression method that increases both the
update and the query throughput of the system. We introduce also a model that skips
over data, avoiding to read unnecessary data.
